Our team is developing a Web App called 'Pulse App'

More of an emotional regulator app, this web app is able to read a user's pulse rate and determine their emotion/mood then display to the user that information

An external device(Pulse detector Device) programmed using Arduino is used to  

clients are able to create and manage their own account on the 'Pulse App' 

It also includes a music player with limited songs(soon to be updated) where the user can play their choice of music
