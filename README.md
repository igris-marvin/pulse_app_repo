Our team is developing a Web App called 'Pulse App'

More of an emotional regulator app, this web app is able to read a user's pulse rate and determine their emotion/mood then display to the user that information

clients are able to create and manage their own account on the 'Pulse App' 

It also includes a music player with limited songs(soon to be updated) where the user can play their choice of music
